            <p>To a large extent, the traditional clinical operation needs to rely on the professional skills of doctors and accumulated years of experience to complete, so there are disadvantages of poor stability and low accuracy. In order to overcome the shortcomings of traditional clinical surgery, domestic and foreign scientific research institutions and enterprises have developed medical surgical robots, which are used as an auxiliary tool to expand doctors' surgical ability. The surgical robot can assist the doctor to carry out the operation under the guidance of real-time medical images during the operation and timely adjustment, which can effectively eliminate the doctor's operation error and reduce the doctor's work intensity, thereby improving the accuracy and stability, and improving the patient's diagnosis and treatment effect.
            In image-guided surgery, imaging technology covers the whole operation, and the quality and timeliness of images often directly determine the surgical treatment and surgical effect. Common intraoperative imaging techniques include ultrasonic imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, CT, etc. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a kind of imaging technology that uses the signal generated by hydrogen nuclei in a magnetic field to reconstruct the image. Magnetic resonance imaging mechanism has no ionizing radiation damage to human body; 3D image can be obtained directly. It shows clearly the soft tissue structure, especially beneficial for the surgical process such as blood vessels and nervous system. Therefore, magnetic resonance image-guided surgical robot has important research value and good application prospect.</p>
